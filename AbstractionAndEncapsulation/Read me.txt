- I assume that item details is combination of name, category, price, quantity, and item type.

- I assume that value is a product of price and quantity.

- I have some difficulties to make a differnce between type and category, i found this on the intertnet:
"Basically Type is a N to 1 relationship (a thing can be of only one Type) and Category is a M to N relationship (a thing can have many categories at the same time)."
but from "8." says "Create subclasses for specific item types like ElectronicsItem, GroceryItem, and FragileItem that inherit from InventoryItem."
